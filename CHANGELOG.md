## [3.1.0-alpha] - 2025-12-06 🧪 "Context Intelligence"

### Experimental
- **🧠 Context-Driven Decision Engine**: Introduction of Semantic Risk Analysis for Guardian Agent.
- **🗺️ Risk Map**: New `.✨/risk-map.json` configuration to define risk scores per file path.
- **Shadow Mode**: Guardian Agent now calculates `semantic_risk_score` in logs without blocking merges (data collection phase).
- **🏗️ Hybrid Dispatcher**: `agent-dispatcher.yml` is now a thin wrapper around `scripts/dispatcher-core.ps1`.
- **🚦 Risk-Based Routing**: Dispatcher now routes high-risk issues (from `risk-map.json`) to Human/Senior Review automatically.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-06 🚀 "Full Autonomy"

### Added

- **🧠 Planner Agent**: New `planner-agent.yml` workflow that reads `ARCHITECTURE.md` and generates atomic issues automatically.
- **🛡️ Guardian Agent**: New `guardian-agent.yml` workflow with confidence scoring for auto-merge decisions.
- **Autonomous Cycle**: Complete development cycle without human intervention (except high-stakes operations).
- **Features Tracking**: New `.✨/features.json` template for tracking feature status.
- **New Labels**: `high-stakes`, `needs-human`, `auto-merged`, `ai-plan`, `planner-generated`.

### Changed

- **AGENTS.md**: Major update with v3.0 autonomous agent documentation.
- **Dispatcher Enhanced**: `agent-dispatcher.yml` now supports skill-matching strategy (planned).
- **Version Bump**: Protocol version updated to `3.0.0`.

### Breaking Changes

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-04

### Added


- **Real Quarantine Logic**: `context-research-agent` now queries NPM, Crates.io, and PyPI APIs to verify package release dates.
- **Binary Automation**: New `build-tools.yml` workflow automatically compiles Rust agents and commits binaries to `bin/`.
- **Recursive Workflow Protection**: `workflow-validator` now detects and prevents infinite recursion loops.
- **Unified Versioning**: All protocol files now reference v1.4.0.

### Changed

- **Installer Update**: `install.ps1` and `install.sh` now include the `bin/` directory for pre-compiled tools.
- **Cleanup**: Removed deprecated `tools/deprecated/git-core-cli` folder.
- **Docs**: Updated `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` to reflect v1.4.0 capabilities.

### Fixed

- **CI Spam**: Fixed a bug where `workflow-validator` would trigger itself, creating hundreds of branches.
- **Metadata Inconsistency**: Unified version tags across all documentation files.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-01
